# Data analysis with SQL
Over the past few years, ride-sharing apps have been on the rise across any cities in the world. While this has happened, Uber and Lyft's ride prices are not constant like public transport. They are greatly affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time.

In this project we will come up with a descriptive analysis report to help a Ride-Sharing Startup understand the various patterns on how pricing works for the existing ride-sharing companies.

We will analyze the prices of these ride-sharing apps and try to figure out what drives the demand.

We will try to find out if the following factors drive the demand for rides:

1. Time of the day
   - Do times around 9 am and 5 pm have the highest price surges as a result of people commuting to work/home?
2. Weather
   - Does rain cause more people to take rides?
3. Day of the week
   - Is the demand for rides higher on Monday compared to Thursday?
